## Art of Rally Leaderboard Python Library

[Art of Rally](https://www.funselektor.com/) by Fun Selektor is a multi-platform arcade-style racing game. Drivers can compete against other drivers via the
leaderboard. You can check your standings in the game, but this is for getting leaderboards from the API endpoint.

### Usage

* Installation: `tbd`
* Set your Platform Default Value.
    ```
      Epic: 0,
      GOG: 1,
      Steam: 2,
      Xbox: 3,
      PlayStation: 4,:
      Nintendo: 5,:

This Python Library pulls heavily from the work of [Thea Sch√∂bl](https://github.com/Theaninova) Who put together all of
the API documentation in one place here: [ArtOfRallyLeaderboardAPI](https://github.com/Theaninova/ArtOfRallyLeaderboardAPI)
Please send a thanks for the hard work.
