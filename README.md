## Art of Rally Leaderboard Python Library

[Art of Rally](https://www.funselektor.com/) by FunSelektor is a multi-platform arcade-style racing game. Drivers can compete against other drivers via the
leaderboard. You can check your standings in game, but this is for getting leaderboards from the API endpoint.

Any questions? Contact me on Github at `https://github.com/chadjemmett` and I'm

### Usage

*Note: The API URLs are case-sensitive. So if something isn't working capitalize the value you pass into the functions*

#### Installation: ` pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ art-of-rally-leaderboard`

 ``` 
import art_of_rally_leaderboard  
board = art_of_rally_leaderboard.Leaderboard(default_platform=2)
board.top_ten("Finland", "Palus", "Group2", direction="Forward", wx="Dry")
print(board)

 {'result': 0, 'leaderboard': 

    [{'uniqueID': 61, 'userName': 'coXXXney', 'rank': 1, 'score': 182017, 'country': 166, 'carID': 2, 'replayData': 'dt7-h01v2Sa7OPgvnpDOnO6igys', 'platformID': 5, 'userID': 'Switch_227XXXXXXXX65AFB'},  
...
 {'uniqueID': 181, 'userName': 'XXXn', 'rank': 9, 'score': 220556, 'country': 23, 'carID': 0, 'replayData': 'EnV9-dQXXXgiT2aG_S72DZgtaBo', 'platformID': 5, 'userID': 'Switch_EF9EXXXXXXXXCA8B'}, 

 {'uniqueID': 384, 'userName': 'TXXXn', 'rank': 10, 'score': 221566, 'country': 166, 'carID': 5, 'replayData': 'TzGJ267q0XXXXXXXXY_WM8Iab1Q', 'platformID': 5, 'userID': 'Switch_37F9E0XXXXX20FF2'}]

```
 Right now the default platform is Steam. These are all the platforms and their codes.
 You can set the default when invoking the class. `board = Leaderboard(default_platform=4)` if you want to get leaderboards for Playstation.
 ```
      Epic: 0,
      GOG: 1,
      Steam: 2,
      Xbox: 3,
      PlayStation: 4,
      Nintendo: 5,
      None: 6
```
The values for the Group variable are as follows:
```
  "Group2",
  "Group3", 
  "Group4",
  "GroupB",
  "GroupS",
  "GroupA",
  "Vans",
  "Triwheeler",
  "Trucks",
  "Logging"

```


Area, Stage and group are required. The default for stages is direction = Forward. And wx = Dry

The two options for Direction is Forward or Reverse, and Wx's options are Wet or Dry 

### Roadmap

- [ ] Human-readable scores. Currently the scores are in this format 142031. In minutes, seconds, and fractions of a second, this translates to 2:22.031. So we need a function that translates that for the Json object. Makes it easier for a human to read. 
- [ ] Individual scores. User passes in their player ID and gets back their score.
- [ ] Full scoreboard. User wants a full listing of scores from the top down to n. User can see their
    progression up the leaderboard.



### Thanks to...
This Python Library pulls heavily from the work of [Thea Sch√∂bl](https://github.com/Theaninova) Who put together all of
the API documentation in one place here: [ArtOfRallyLeaderboardAPI](https://github.com/Theaninova/ArtOfRallyLeaderboardAPI)
Please send a thanks for the hard work.
